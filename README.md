# Function and Operator Overloading in C++
## Aim
To study overloading in C++.

## Theory
In C++, function overloading is a feature that allows multiple functions to have the same name but differ in the number or types of their parameters. This enables a more intuitive and flexible way of handling functions that perform similar operations on different types or quantities of inputs. When a function is called, the compiler determines which version of the function to invoke based on the argument types and numbers passed. For example, a function `add()` can be overloaded to handle both integers and floating-point numbers by defining multiple versions of `add()`, one accepting integers and another accepting floats. Function overloading improves code readability by using the same function name for similar operations, avoiding the need to create distinct names for each variation. However, the functions must differ by parameter types or the number of parameters since the return type alone cannot differentiate overloaded functions. This feature is particularly useful in object-oriented programming, where the same action might need to be performed on various types of data, such as handling different numeric types or performing operations on objects of different classes. Overloading makes the code cleaner and more maintainable by unifying the logic under a single function name.
